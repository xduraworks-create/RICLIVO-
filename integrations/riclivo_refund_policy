Riclivo Refund Policy 

> At Riclivo Technologies, we aim to ensure seamless financial operations for our users.
Refund requests are processed only after proper verification of the transaction source and confirmation from the user’s linked account or card.

Refunds may take 3–7 business days depending on the user’s bank or payment processor.

Refunds are credited to the original payment method used.

Unauthorized or disputed transactions will be investigated before a refund is approved.
