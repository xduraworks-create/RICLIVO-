Title: Banking Integration ‚Äì Open Banking (Nordigen / GoCardless)


---

Purpose

Riclivo connects securely to users‚Äô bank accounts using Nordigen (GoCardless) ‚Äî an EU-regulated Open Banking API.
This enables:

Real-time transaction fetching

Balance verification

Refund source identification

Account linkage for reclaim and bookkeeping processes.



---

API Endpoints

Function	Endpoint	Method	Description

List institutions	/institutions/	GET	Fetch available banks for user‚Äôs region.
Create requisition	/requisitions/	POST	Generate consent link for user authorization.
Retrieve accounts	/accounts/	GET	Get authorized accounts under a requisition.
Fetch transactions	/accounts/{id}/transactions/	GET	Retrieve all recent transactions.
Fetch balances	/accounts/{id}/balances/	GET	Get account balance information.



---

Authentication

OAuth2-based system.

Each user consents once ‚Üí Riclivo stores a refreshable access token.

Tokens are encrypted and stored in auth_keys table (Google Sheets / Firebase).

Tokens auto-renew using Nordigen‚Äôs refresh endpoint.



---

Flow Summary

1. User selects their bank and region (auto-detected from localization sheet).


2. Riclivo redirects to the Nordigen consent page for authentication.


3. Upon success, Riclivo stores:

institution_id

requisition_id

account_id



4. Background job (via Glide Action + Script) fetches:

Balances ‚Üí accounts sheet

Transactions ‚Üí transactions sheet



5. Riclivo automatically tags eligible failed or duplicate transactions for potential refund claims.

Error Handling

Code	Cause	Resolution

400	Invalid payload	Check user consent or expired session.
401	Token expired	Auto-refresh via stored refresh token.
404	Institution not supported	Fallback to manual import or CSV upload.
500	Bank server error	Retry after 10 mins (limit 3 retries).



---

Security Notes

All API keys stored in .env or Glide Config Sheet (hidden fields).

HTTPS enforced for every transaction.

Riclivo never stores user credentials ‚Äî only access tokens post-consent.

Logs stored for 30 days for auditing, then anonymized.

Future Expansion

Add Plaid / Mono / Okra / Truelayer for region-specific support.

Enable instant refunds via bank rails where legally permitted.

Support multi-currency balance sync for cross-border users.
