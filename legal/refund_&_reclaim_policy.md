**Effective Date:** October 2025  
**Last Updated:** October 7, 2025  

At **Riclivo**, our goal is to make refunds, reclaims, and dispute resolutions simple, transparent, and fair.  
This Refund Policy explains how refunds and reclaims are processed across user tiers — Freemium, Premium, and Business — and what conditions apply to each.

## 1. Overview

Riclivo operates as an **AI-powered financial reconciliation assistant**, helping users identify and reclaim wrongful charges, excess deductions, and failed transactions.  
Refunds are issued either:
- By the **original bank or payment processor**, or  
- As a **Riclivo-managed reclaim**, where Riclivo assists the user in obtaining the refund.
